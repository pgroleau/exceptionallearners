                    What is Inclusion?
                </h2>
                    <p>Inclusion refers to the acceptance of diverse (physically, intellectually, socio-economically, and culturally) student populations within a classroom. An inclusive classroom seeks to break down barriers that inhibit the learning of certain types of students like those who are English language learners, have learning disabilities, or who come from culturally diverse communities. Having inclusive course content that is tailored to a variety of cultural backgrounds and learning styles is imperative to creating a classroom that meets needs of <em>all</em> students.</p>

                <h2>
                    Why Teach for Diversity?
                </h2>
                    <p>Our classrooms are growing more diverse with each new generation, yet we don't see equitable levels of academic achievement across different socio-economic and cultural populations (Saravia-Shore). This difference in academic achievement is called the achievement gap (Saravia-Shore). Luckily, there a demonstrated techniques for closing this gap and making school an inclusive place for all students. Teachers need to be mindful of these techniques in order to see all of their students succeed.     
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, we teach for diversity, not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it provides the best educational outcomes across all student populations.</p>
                <h2>
                    How to Teach Diverse Student Populations
                </h2>
                    <p>
                    There are many different ways teachers can meet the needs of their diverse student populations. Some include: differentiated instruction, universal design, sheltered instruction, and multicultural educaiton (Voltz, Sims, Nelson).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Differentiated instruction refers to a teacher adapting his or her curriculum to meet the diverse needs of their students (Voltz, Sims, Nelson). For instance, the teacher could assign different materials to meet individual students needs or adjust goals and expectations depending upon the student's skill and abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Universal design refers to an instructional approach wherein curriculum is,  "designed from the beginning with students' diverse needs in mind" (Voltz, Sims, Nelson). With particular attention paid to students with, "physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities," universal design seeks to design a classroom space&mdash;especially using auto/visual assistive technology&mdash;so that students with diverse needs are included in a teacher's lesson plans.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sheltered instruction is designed to meet the needs of English language learners (ELL) in particular (Voltz, Sims, Nelson). It involves the preparation, background, and execution of simple, grade-level vocabulary that allows ELL students to access prior knowledge as well as connect with their peers. It also involves adapting lessons to suit the ELL student's profeciency in the English language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, multicultural education is, as the name suggest, an approach to education wherin multicultural perspectives are celebrated. The pillars of multicultural education include: content integration, the knowledge construction process, bias reduction, empowering school culture, and equity pedagogy (Voltz, Sims, Nelson). At its core, multicultural education ensures one worldview is not privilidged amongst others within the classroom and its curriculum.

                    Collaborating with Diverse Families
                </h2>
                    <p>
                    Families can be an invaluable resource for teachers of diverse communities and it is imperative for those teachers to open channels of communication with those families. It is important to note that teachers can't have a "one-size-fits-all" for family relationships. Instead, they need to tailor their communication style so that it is helpful and collaborative for each individual familiy with whom they are speaking. 
                </p>
                    <p>Understanding cutural differences, listening to family concerns, treating each family member as an individual, planning and implementing goals, and establishing a strong rapport can go a long way in forging the connections that will help when teaching diverse populations (Voltz and Hardy Morrow). Lastly, it is important to respond appropriately to cultural expectations and be aware of what behaviors and interactions are prosocial within different multicultural settings.

                    Challenges in Teaching Diverse Students
                </h2>
                <p>Teaching a diverse student body is not without its challenges. Differences in ethnicity, language, ability, and culture mean teachers need to take a global, multicultural, and inclusive worldview when designing their classrooms. They need to embrace their student's diverse needs and conbat ignorance whenever it shows up. All students benefit from a multicultural education and it is a teacher's job to provide the best education possible (Saravia-Shore).</p>
